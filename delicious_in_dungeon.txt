Delicious in Dungeon is a very well-written series based on a manga (japanese comic) written by a woman.
The premise of the story is about cooking monsters in a D&D setting.
However, the underlying plot has many layers (like an onion, yum) and has you on the edge of your seat.
The first opening song has a super fun jingle-y tune.
What I LOVE about the series is that the protagonist is very neurodivergent-coded, and he is represented very well.
I cannot stress this enough-- do watch it! It's on Netflix.
PS: There is also a gag where a curly haired guy dies and ressurects multiple times. I find it very funny.
